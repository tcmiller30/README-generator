## Description

This application can be used by developers to quickly generate a properly layed out README file for their application. Using their terminal, the user will be asked a series of questions pertaining to the application that requires the README to be generated. When all the questions have been answered, the application will generate a README file populated with the info provided by the user. The generated README will have the provided info separated into different section and include working links to GitHub and the user's contact email. The application will also implement a table of contents into the README for better navigation.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

This application is dependent on the Inquirer and FS Node Modules to run. Before use, the user should run the command [npm i]/[npm install] in their terminal to allow the program to install dependencies.

## Usage

In order to use this application, after having installed the necessary dependencies, the user should start by typing the command [node index.js] in their command terminal/console. When the command is entered properly, the user will be presented with a series of questions about their application, starting with the title. The user should respond to each prompt with the information they wish to be displayed to future users of their application.

When asked to enter a license for the application, the user can navigate the list using the arrow keys. When the desired license is highlighted, the user should press the "Enter" key to confirm their selection.

After a few more questions, the user will recieve confirmation in the console that the README.md file has been successfully created, and the user will find the resulting file in the application's root folder.
